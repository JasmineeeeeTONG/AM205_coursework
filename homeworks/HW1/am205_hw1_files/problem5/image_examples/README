Python and MATLAB examples for loading and saving images
--------------------------------------------------------
The Python library "skimage" can be used to read in images into NumPy arrays.
This directory contains two Python examples for reading in images:

- load_image.py reads in a greyscale image "thirlmere.png" into an M by N
  array. The image is then plotted using Matplotlib.

- split_channel.py reads in a color image "rubik.png" into an M by N by 3 array called "a".
  The red channel is held in a[:,:,0], the green channel is held in a[:,:,1],
  and the blue channel is held in a[:,:,2]. The program outputs each of these
  three channels as separate images.

MATLAB also has functionality for reading images. The program
"load_image_split_channel.m" performs the same tasks as two Python examples
listed above.
